    <b>Permissions</b>
    <p>The following is a breakdown of the permission needed for the API user to be able to use the action in this app. These permissions are controlled in the IAM section of the ETP server.
      For information pertaining to setting up the API user refer to the API documentation located at <a href="https://docs.fireeye.com/docs/index.html#ETP" target="_blank">https://docs.fireeye.com/docs/index.html#ETP</a>.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    For any API access, the following entitlements are required:
    <ul>
      <li>iam.users.browse</li>
      <li>iam.orgs.self.read</li>
    </ul>

    For accessing alerts APIs, the following additional entitlements are required:
    <ul>
      <li>etp.alerts.read</li>
    </ul>

    For accessing trace APIs, the following additional entitlements are required:
    <ul>
      <li>etp.email_trace.read</li>
    </ul>

    For accessing quarantine APIs, the following additional entitlements are required:
    <ul>
      <li>etp.quarantine.update</li>
      <li>etp.quarantine.read</li>
      <li>etp.quarantine.delete</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Actions</b>
    <p>
      It is important to know that all the actions in this app take affect on the Fireeye ETP side, except for <i>remediating email</i>. For example, deleting a quarantined
      email is the action that deletes the email in the Fireeye ETP quarantined section, not in the Office365. Office365 may have other actions for quarantined emails from their own security suite
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Remediate Email action</i>
      <p>
        This action talks to the API for Office365 which will move/delete the email depending on the input from the user. This action does not have an undo function and if the user selects action_overrite
        of delete, this email will be permanently deleted in the Office365 environment and not recoverable. Use cautiously!
      </p>

  <h2>Port Information</h2>
      <p>
